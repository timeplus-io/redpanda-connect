Executes a query on Timeplus Enterprise and creates a message from each row received

```yml
# Config fields, showing default values
input:
  label: ""
  timeplus:
    query: select * from iot # No default (required)
    url: tcp://localhost:8463
    workspace: "" # No default (optional)
    apikey: "" # No default (optional)
    username: "" # No default (optional)
    password: "" # No default (optional)
```

This input can execute a query on Timeplus Enterprise Cloud, Timeplus Enterprise (self-hosted) or Timeplusd. A structured message will be created
from each row received.

If it is a streaming query, this input will keep running until the query is terminated. If it is a table query, this input will shut down once the rows from the query are exhausted.
